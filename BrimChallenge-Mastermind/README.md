### What is Brim?

Brim is a GUI based program allowing you to analyse .pcap files and Zeek logs. As you should have learned from Zeek, it specifies the entire .pacp files in multiple different categories of logs which is EXACTLY what Brim does also (it literally uses the Zeek engine). We can then query these logs from the .pcap file with super simple command line like queries. In short, Brim is pretty much a GUI based version to inspect Zeek logs with simple querying. Brim is NOT a IDS or IPS, it simply analyses already generated .pcap files.
